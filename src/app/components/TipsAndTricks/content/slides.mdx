# Improving Slides

- **Slides consists of two components: the star note and the slide itself.** The star is a tap note and is graded as such. **It's important to ALWAYS treat it as a tap**. After you tap, **the slide will begin moving one beat later**.
- You'll notice that the star is rotating as it comes in. **The speed of the rotation determines how fast the slide will go**. A star spinning fast like a shuriken means the slide will usually finish in 1 beat as well. So if you imagine 4 beats per measure, you can treat it like: "Tap. SLIDE. Tap. SLIDE." With each SLIDE completing the whole thing.
- You'll sometimes notice that there are slides that follow each other one after the other. **These back-to-back slides are very important to sync properly!** The idea is that after you initially tap the first star note, **you are sliding one beat later, which will, at the same time, also hit the _next_ star note**. Visualizing it as 4 beats per measure, this goes "Tap. SLIDE. SLIDE. SLIDE." **Remember that all these sequences require WAITING one beat after tapping the first star note!!!**
- Your general goal is to try shooting up to Expert 12, where the game will start introducing multitasking with slides a bit more.
