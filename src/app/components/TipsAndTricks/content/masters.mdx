# Master Difficulty

- Look for MASTERS with the Note Designer **緑風 犬三郎**. These MASTER charts are designed for players who are getting into the MASTER difficulty after they've learned how to S-Rank Level 12 Experts or better.
- **Avoid the end of the folder and suspiciously low Masters.** These are old charts and not rated correctly. Stick to the newer versions if possible.
- You should be comfortable throughout Level 12+ and Level 13 Experts. In turn, this should let you play Level 12 and Level 12+ Masters.
