# I'm a First-Time Player!

## What Difficulty Should I Play?
What's your background with rhythm games?
- **If you haven't touched a single rhythm game** before or have only played things super casually, **start with Basic**!
- **If you've played rhythm games before**, whether it's DDR groovin' to Butterfly or you're kinning and hearing the bells toll in Project Sekai, **start with Advanced**! Set your speed between 3.0, the recommend speed for Advanced, to 4.5.
- **If you have high fundamentals and excel in rhythm games like WACCA, Arcaea, or osu!**, you should try the hardest Advanced charts or play **Experts around Level 10!** Set your speed to 3.0 - 4.5.

## What Songs Should I Pick?
- **Stick with newer songs!** Open up the Recommended folder or either the POPS&ANIME folder or niconico&Vocaloid! Then pick a song with a comfy BPM or something you recognize!
- **Don't try to pick songs at the end of the folder.** Those older songs have harder difficulty curves.
